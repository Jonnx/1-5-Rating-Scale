--------------------------------------

This is a simple CSS library that allows you to create a fully customizable 1-5 rating scale input. This is built only with HTML and CSS. All interactions in your web application can then easily be created with JavaScript or jQuery.

The scale effect is created by nesting 5 HTML elements and letting the :hover state propagate through the different layers. Clicking the Show / Hide Markup Structure button reveals the exact way the nesting achieves the desired effect.

This simple code can be used in HTML email templates as well since it does not require Javascript. Simply point the link tags to an endpoint of your site and add URL parameters to create some interaction of your email and your site.
Drive engagement by getting creative!
